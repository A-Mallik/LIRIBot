# LIRIBot
A bot running on nodejs which will output spotify titles, movie info, and concert dates.
' LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.'
